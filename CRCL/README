NOTE:
This code is designed to use the Schunk powercube gripper. This is
a USB serial device that uses the Prolific USB-to-Serial controller.
If using Oracle VirtualBox to control this device, you must enable
the USB filters in the settings menu for the virtual machine.
To do this, Right-click on the virtual machine when the machine is not
running and edit the USB devices.

The USB port will not be read/write for all users as configured. To configure,
copy the file 80-serial.rules from the etc director (./etc from this directory)
to the /etc/udev/rules.d/ directory. Then 
restart the udev daemon with the command: sudo udevadm trigger
