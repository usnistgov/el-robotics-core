\section{Introduction}

This document describes the different ideas that will need to be implemented to represent and identify action failures during the execution of kitting tasks by a robotic arm. In our kitting domain, PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) actions, predicates, and initial and goal states are used by a planner to generate a plan that contains a sequence of PDDL actions to perform in order to build a kit. During the execution of the plan, the interpreter, from the execution module, acquires information on the location of different objects in the workstation. 


In order to represent and identify failures during kitting, the following modules need to be implemented:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Representation of PDDL actions in the ontology (Section~\ref{task1})
\item Representation of Failures associated to actions (Section~\ref{task2})
\item Representation of predicates with state relations (Section~\ref{task3})
\item Update of the MySQL database (Section~\ref{task4})
\end{enumerate}
