\section{Compile and Run the Executor}
Once the executor project is built using the tutorial in section~\ref{section:build} one can build the project as follows.

\begin{itemize}
\item Using a Linux shell, place yourself in the \texttt{executor} directory.
\item \texttt{./configure}
\item \texttt{make}
\end{itemize}

The executable file \file{executor} is generated in the \texttt{bin} directory. To launch the executor:
\begin{itemize}
\item Using a Linux shell, place yourself in the \texttt{bin} directory.
\item \texttt{./executor}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Configuration File}
The input and output files for the executor are currently hard-coded. These filenames are set in the file \texttt{Config.h} and may be changed by the user (with a 
recompile required) to change the input and output behavior of the system.
