\section{The Kitting Domain}\label{kitting_domain}

The foundation for the knowledge representation is domain specific information that is produced by an expert in the particular field of study. This includes
information on items ranging from what actions and attributes are relevant, to what the necessary conditions are for an action to occur and what the
likely results of the action are. We have chosen to encode this basic information in a formalism know as a state variable representation (SVR) \cite{NAU.2004}.
This information will then flow up the abstraction and be transformed into the ontology, planning language, and robot language.\\
Before building a SVR, the domain for kitting needs to be specified. The domain for kitting contains some fixed equipment: a robot, a work table, end effectors, end effector holders, and an end effector changing station. Items that enter the workstation include kit trays, boxes in which to put kits, boxes that contain empty kit trays, and part supplies. Items that leave the workstation may be boxes with finished kits inside, empty part trays, empty boxes. An external agent is responsible of moving the items that leave the workstation. We assume that the workstation has only one work table, one changing station, and one robot.
