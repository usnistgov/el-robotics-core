Metrics for industrial kit building have been developed based on a
knowledge model. A configurable method of computing a net score from the
metrics has been developed. A Kitting Viewer has been developed that
simulates the execution of a plan in the form of a robot command file
intended to take a kitting workstation from an inital state to a goal
state. The Kitting Viewer computes the metrics and a final score for the
plan.

The Kitting Viewer is fully operational, but further improvements are
planned. The first significant planned improvement is to allow identical
parts in the goal file to be interchangeable. That is, for example, if
parts A and B are identical, and the goal file has part A in position 1 and
part B in position 2, it will be equally valid to put part B in position 1
and part A in position 2.

Other desirable improvements include: 1) using OWL instance files as input, 2) using grasp points (the model includes grasp points), 3) reading and displaying external shapes (the model includes references to external shape files), 4) implementing animation of gripper rotation, 5) using other types of grippers, and 6) implementing kinematics of commercial robots.
