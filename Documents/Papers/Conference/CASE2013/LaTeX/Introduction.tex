The authors have developed a canonical robot control language (CRCL) that
attempts to be a lowest common denominator of robot programing languages.
It is anticipated that kitting plans can be translated into CRCL command
sets which may then be evaluated by standardized metric software. The CRCL
command sets may then be translated into a specific robot platform's
language.
