\begin{abstract}

The IEEE Robotics and Automation Society's (RAS) Ontologies for Robotics
and Automation Working Group is dedicated to developing a methodology for
knowledge representation and reasoning in robotics and automation. As part
of this working group, the Industrial Robots sub-group is tasked with
studying industrial applications of the knowledge representation. One of
the first areas of interest for this subgroup is the area of kit building
or kitting. This is a process that brings parts that will be used in
assembly operations together in a kit and then moves the kit to the
assembly area where the parts are used in the final assembly. It is
anticipated that utilization of the knowledge representation will allow for
the development of higher performing kitting systems. While our previous
effort aimed at designing the basis for performance methods and metrics to
determine higher performing kitting systems, this paper presents a system
that evaluates the performance of kitting systems through simulation using
specific metrics.

%\addtolength{\textheight}{-4cm}
 % This command serves to balance the column lengths
 % on the last page of dthe document manually. It shortens
 % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
 % This command does not take effect until the next page
 % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
 % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
