Kit building or kitting is a process in which separate but related items are grouped, packaged, and supplied together as one unit (kit). This paper describes advances in the development of kitting simulation tools that incorporate sensing/control and parts detection capabilities.

To pick and place parts and components during kitting, the kitting workcell relies on a simulated sensor system to retrieve the six-degree of freedom (6DOF) pose estimation of each of these objects. While the use of a sensor system allows objects' poses to be obtained, it also helps detecting failures during the execution of a kitting plan when some of these objects are missing or are not at the expected locations.

A simulated kitting system is presented and the approach that is used to task a sensor system to retrieve 6DOF pose estimation of specific objects (objects of interest) is given.
