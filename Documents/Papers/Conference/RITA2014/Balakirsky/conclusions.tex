\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sect:future}
The framework described in this paper has been applied to the domain of kit building, which is a simple, but practically useful manufacturing/assembly domain. Through its use, we have been able to demonstrate agility in both kit construction through late binding of part locations, and in recovery from action failures.

There are several areas that still exist where hand-coding of data is required. It is desired that extensions to the ontology be created that will allow for the automatic application of knowledge and eliminate code that it specifically tuned to a particular set of predicates or actions. The hand-coded areas include the conversion of PDDL actions to CRCL sequences as well as the retrieval of instance data from the MySQL database for predicate evaluation. Work is currently underway to correct for these deficiencies. 

Extensions are also possible that will expand this work to the realm of general assembly. We hope to apply this knowledge based framework to simple assembly tasks (growing towards more complex tasks) on a real robot workcell in the near future.
