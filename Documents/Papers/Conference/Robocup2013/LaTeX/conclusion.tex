\section*{CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK}\label{s:conclusion}
This paper has presented a new ROS package that allows for the seamless interface of USARSim with ROS. 
The package provides for auto-discovery of robots and sensors, and produces the standard ROS topics that one would expect from a physical platform. 
Several researchers from outside the RoboCup community~\cite{haberjmesim,meyer2012comprehensive} have already tried this interface. %vannoort2013extending,
Still, further work is needed to provide the control interface for legged robots (as the Nao robot) and flying robots (such as the AirRobot and the AR.Drone).
%Further work is still required to auto-generate ROS launch files for running standard motion control algorithms for both platform and arm control. 
In addition, the whole sensor suite must have their USARSim interfaces wrapped to be supported in the ROS environment.
On the positive site, as the Darpa Robotics Challenge is based on the ROS framework, progress in this competition could be an advance for the RoboCup, and vice versa.
