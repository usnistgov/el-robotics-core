We believe that building models of the world knowledge is a necessary step towards operating an automated kitting workstation. The proposed models include representations for non-executable information about the workstation such as information about parts, kits, and trays. The description of these models includes for instance the location, orientation, and relation between components. These models are discussed in Section~\ref{owlkitting}.

Models of executable information are also produced from the system information described in the SVR. These models include actions, actions' precondition, actions' effect, and actions' failures that consist of different spatial relations. A description of these models is given in Section~\ref{owlsoap}.

Section~\ref{owlinit} and Section~\ref{owlgoal} describe the init and goal files, respectively, generated from the data structure and information in the models of the world knowledge.

The rest of this section describes the two proposed different models along with their representation in the ontologies presented in Figure~\ref{fig:DesignArchitecture}. The models were defined in OWL's functional-style syntax~\cite{OWLspec}.
