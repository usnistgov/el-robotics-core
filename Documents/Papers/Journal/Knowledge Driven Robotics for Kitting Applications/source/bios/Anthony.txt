He received a Master’s Degree in Computer Science from the University of Burgundy specialized in Databases and artificial Intelligence.
Mr. Pietromartire’s current research is focused on simulation-based planning and control for kit building in manufacturing environments. The objective of this problem is to develop the measurement science and standards for planning and modeling by robots so that they are able to be more quickly re-tasked and are more flexible and adaptive.
