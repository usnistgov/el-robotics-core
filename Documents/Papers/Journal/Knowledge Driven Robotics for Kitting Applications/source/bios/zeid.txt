Dr. Zeid Kootbally is an Assistant Research Scientist with the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park. 
He received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Burgundy for a dissertation on Moving Object Predictions in Dynamic Environments for Autonomous Ground Vehicles.
Dr. Kootbally’s current research is focused on simulation-based planning and control for kit building in manufacturing environments. 
The objective of this problem is to develop the measurement science and standards for planning and modeling by robots so that they 
are able to be more quickly re-tasked and are more flexible and adaptive.
