% version 1.2 dated 09 May 2011

% This file (c) 2009-2011 Elsevier Ltd.  Modifications may be freely made,
% provided the edited file is saved under a different name

% This file contains modifications for Procedia Computer Science
% but may easily be adapted to other journals

% Changes since version 1.1
% - added "procedia" option compliant with ecrc.sty version 1.2a
%   (makes the layout approximately the same as the Word CRC template)
% - added example for generating copyright line in abstract

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

%% This template uses the elsarticle.cls document class and the extension package ecrc.sty
%% For full documentation on usage of elsarticle.cls, consult the documentation "elsdoc.pdf"

%% The '3p' and 'times' class options of elsarticle are used for Elsevier CRC
%% Add the 'procedia' option to approximate to the Word template
%\documentclass[3p,times,procedia]{elsarticle}
\documentclass[3p,times]{elsarticle}

%% The `ecrc' package must be called to make the CRC functionality available
\usepackage{ecrc}

%% The ecrc package defines commands needed for running heads and logos.
%% For running heads, you can set the journal name, the volume, the starting page and the authors

%% set the volume if you know. Otherwise `00'
\volume{00}

%% set the starting page if not 1
\firstpage{1}

%% Give the name of the journal
\journalname{Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing}

%% Give the author list to appear in the running head
%% Example \runauth{C.V. Radhakrishnan et al.}
\runauth{Z. Kootbally et al.}

%% The choice of journal logo is determined by the \jid and \jnltitlelogo commands.
%% A user-supplied logo with the name <\jid>logo.pdf will be inserted if present.
%% e.g. if \jid{yspmi} the system will look for a file yspmilogo.pdf
%% Otherwise the content of \jnltitlelogo will be set between horizontal lines as a default logo

%% Give the abbreviation of the Journal.  Contact the journal editorial office if in any doubt
\jid{procs}

%% Give a short journal name for the dummy logo (if needed)
\jnltitlelogo{Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing}

%% Provide the copyright line to appear in the abstract
%% Usage:
%   \CopyrightLine[<text-before-year>]{<year>}{<restt-of-the-copyright-text>}
%   \CopyrightLine[Crown copyright]{2011}{Published by Elsevier Ltd.}
%   \CopyrightLine{2011}{Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved}
\CopyrightLine{2014}{Published by Elsevier Ltd.}

%% Hereafter the template follows `elsarticle'.
%% For more details see the existing template files elsarticle-template-harv.tex and elsarticle-template-num.tex.

%% Elsevier CRC generally uses a numbered reference style
%% For this, the conventions of elsarticle-template-num.tex should be followed (included below)
%% If using BibTeX, use the style file elsarticle-num.bst

%% End of ecrc-specific commands
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% The amssymb package provides various useful mathematical symbols
\usepackage{amssymb}
%% The amsthm package provides extended theorem environments
%% \usepackage{amsthm}

%% The lineno packages adds line numbers. Start line numbering with
%% \begin{linenumbers}, end it with \end{linenumbers}. Or switch it on
%% for the whole article with \linenumbers after \end{frontmatter}.
%% \usepackage{lineno}

%% natbib.sty is loaded by default. However, natbib options can be
%% provided with \biboptions{...} command. Following options are
%% valid:

%%   round  -  round parentheses are used (default)
%%   square -  square brackets are used   [option]
%%   curly  -  curly braces are used      {option}
%%   angle  -  angle brackets are used    <option>
%%   semicolon  -  multiple citations separated by semi-colon
%%   colon  - same as semicolon, an earlier confusion
%%   comma  -  separated by comma
%%   numbers-  selects numerical citations
%%   super  -  numerical citations as superscripts
%%   sort   -  sorts multiple citations according to order in ref. list
%%   sort&compress   -  like sort, but also compresses numerical citations
%%   compress - compresses without sorting
%%
%% \biboptions{comma,round}

% \biboptions{}

% if you have landscape tables
\usepackage[figuresright]{rotating}

% put your own definitions here:
%   \newcommand{\cZ}{\cal{Z}}

\begin{abstract}
Kit building or kitting is a process in which individually sep-
arate but related items are grouped, packaged, and supplied together
as one unit (kit). This paper describes advances in developing sens-
ing/control and parts detection technologies enabling robust operation
of kitting applications in simulation.
To pick and place parts and components during kitting, the kitting work-
cell relies on a simulated sensor system to retrieve the six-degree of free-
dom (6DOF) pose estimation of each of these objects. While the use of a
sensor system allows objectsâ€™ poses to be obtained, it also helps detecting
failures during the execution of a kitting plan when some of these objects
are missing or are not at the expected locations.
A kitting system is presented and the approach that is used to task
a sensor system to retrieve 6DOF pose estimation of specific objects
(objects of interest) is given.
