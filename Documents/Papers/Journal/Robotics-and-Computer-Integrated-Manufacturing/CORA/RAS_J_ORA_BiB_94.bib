  abstract = {{OntoClean} is a methodology for validating the ontological adequacy
	and logical consistency of taxonomic relationships. It is based on
	highly general ontological notions drawn from philosophy, like essence,
	identity, and unity, which are used to elicit and characterize the
	intended meaning of properties, classes, and relations making up
	an ontology. These aspects are represented by formal metaproperties,
	which impose several constraints on the taxonomic relationships between
	concepts. The analysis of these constraints helps in evaluating and
	validating the choices made. In this chapter we present an informal
	overview of the philosophical notions involved and their role in
	{OntoClean}, review some common ontological pitfalls, and walk through
	the example that has appeared in pieces in previous papers and has
	been the basis of numerous tutorials and talks.},

	Formal ontologies are viewed as designed artifacts, formulated for
	specific purposes and evaluated against objective design criteria.
	We describe the role of ontologies in supporting knowledge sharing
	activities, and then present a set of criteria to guide the development
	of ontologies for these purposes. We show how these criteria are
	applied in case studies from the design of ontologies for engineering
	mathematics and bibliographic data. Selected design decisions are
	discussed, and alternative representation choices and evaluated against
	the design criteria.}},
