An architecture based on AI and Internet programming is proposed for remotely and quickly accessing bearing design and manufacturing expertise at low cost and thus implementing design and manufacturing agility. The expertise includes the intelligent selection of journal bearings and their mounting techniques as developed so far. The expertise can be accessed globally through the Internet interface with the selection of a bearing type and configuration for a specific rolling bearing application, the bearing mounting details and the bearing lubrication and sealing devices design. The paper concludes with a discussion on the potential benefits, and the future applications of AI and Internet based agile manufacturing technology in industry.},

Design/methodology/approach - Following an introduction to AIMM, this paper investigates the missing links and gaps between the research and developments efforts and the real-world application requirements, in order to bring the AIMM technology from laboratories to manufacturing environments. The investigation is based on 12 general application requirements for robotics: sustainability, configuration, adaptation, autonomy, positioning, manipulation and grasping, robot-robot interaction, human-robot interaction, process quality, dependability, and physical properties. Findings - The concise yet comprehensive review provides both researchers (academia) and practitioners (industry) with a quick and gentle overview of AIMM. Furthermore, the paper identifies key open issues and promising research directions to realize real-world integration and maturation of the AIMM technology.

In this paper we consider how cloud-based data and computation can facilitate 3D robot grasping. We present a system architecture, implemented pro- totype, and initial experimental data for a cloud-based robot grasping system that incorporates a Willow Garage PR2 robot with onboard color and depth cameras, Google’s proprietary object recognition engine, the Point Cloud Library (PCL) for pose estimation, Columbia University’s GraspIt! toolkit and OpenRAVE for 3D grasping and our prior approach to sampling-based grasp analysis to address uncertainty in pose. We report data from experiments in recognition (a recall rate of 80\% for the objects in our test set), pose estimation (failure rate under 14\%), and grasping (failure rate under 23\%) and initial results on recall and false positives in larger data sets using confidence measures.},

A measure of danger during the interaction is explicitly computed, based on factors affecting the impact force during a potential collision between the human and the robot. This danger index is then used as an input to real-time trajectory generation when the index exceeds a predefined threshold. The danger index is formulated to produce a provably stable, fast response in the presence of multiple surrounding obstacles. A motion strategy to minimize the danger index is developed for articulated multi-degree-of-freedom robots. Simulations and experiments show the efficacy of this approach. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This paper presents a synergistic approach to danger assessment and safety-oriented control of articulated robots that are based on a quantity called danger field. This quantity captures the state of the robot as a whole and indicates how dangerous the current posture and velocity of the robot are to the objects in the environment. The field itself is invariant with respect to objects around the robot and can be computed in any given point of the robot\^{a}€™s workspace using measurements from the proprioceptive sensors. Furthermore, the danger field can be expressed in the closed form, which enables its fast computation. Apart from being a pure safety assessment, the danger field provides a natural prelude to safety-oriented control strategy. Namely, the information about the danger field can easily be fed back to shape standard control schemes in order to make the motion of the robot safer to the environment. The proposed method is validated through simulations and experiments.

abstract = {Dimensional variation propagation modeling is a critical enabling technique for product quality variation reduction in a multistage assembly process (MAP). However, the complex inter-stage correlations make the modeling extremely difficult. This paper aims to improve the existing techniques by developing a generic state space approach to modeling 3-D variation propagation induced by various types of variation sources in general MAPs. A concept of differential motion vector (DMV) is adopted to represent deviations with respect to four types of coordinate systems and to formulate the variation propagation as a series of homogeneous transformation among different coordinate systems. Based on this representation and formulation strategy, a novel generic mechanism is proposed to model the effect of variations induced by part fabrication processes and a MAP. A case study on 3-D variation propagation in a panel fitting process is presented to demonstrate the modeling and analysis capability of the proposed methodology.},

It exploits the modeling environment and uses concepts from control theory to model variation propagation and control during assembly. The assembly process is modeled as a multistage linear dynamic system. Two types of assemblies are addressed: Type-1 where the assembly process puts together parts at their pre-fabricated mating features and Type-2 where the process can incorporate in-process adjustments to redistribute variation. Algorithms are developed to determine and control variation in final assembly propagated through the combined effect of individual part variations and choice of assembly methods. Algorithms to propagate variation in the presence of adjustments are also presented. In-process adjustments in Type-2 assemblies are determined by the type of interface features between parts being assembled which are modeled as control inputs to the dynamic system. An optimal control problem is formulated to design these interfaces. Variation associated with final assembly dimensions, cost of making adjustments, and assembly sequence effects are included in the optimization procedure},

The approach looks to exploit simulation in a much wider range of applications with great advantages in the design and development of manufacturing machine systems. In particular, it facilitates the verification of the runtime support applications using the simulation model before they are applied to the real system. Mechanisms that allow runtime data to be collected during operation of the real machinery to calibrate the simulation models are also proposed. The system implemented delivers a powerful set of software tools for realising agile modular manufacturing systems. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper describes a vision of how robots can effectively be introduced in small-parts assembly lines to (partly) automate the assembly line. We particularly consider small part assembly lines which are frequently changing, for example due to small product batch sizes and product changeover. In this scenario manual assembly lines are currently preferred since automation is deemed to be economically unviable and inflexible. Flexible robot systems that can be set-up and configured efficiently and effectively are considered to be one of the key factors to make the introduction of industrial robot automation in such conditions viable. Another key-enabler is to be able to introduce robots without having to install too much external safety equipment (e.g. fencing) since this occupies too much space and makes it more difficult to achieve efficient human-robot collaboration. The \#x0022;ROSETTA approach \#x0022; described and discussed in this paper can pave the way to achieve such a flexible robot system. ROSETTA is an acronym for ??RObot control for Skilled ExecuTion of Tasks in natural interaction with humans; based on Autonomy, cumulative knowledge and learning??. The three cornerstones of the approach described here are safe human-robot collaboration, simplified robot programming, and automatic learning/optimization in robot program execution. It is believed that if development can be made in those three areas industrial robot automation can be made applicable for the small-parts assembly industry.

abstract = {The opportunities of mass customization are acknowledged as fundamentally positive by theoretical and empirical studies for many years. Many companies are already operating on this new business model successfully. But most of them are rather small start-ups which utilize the novelty effect of mass customization to enter mature markets. Large scale mass customization operations are still limited to a few examples. The objective of this paper is to analyze the recent state of mass customization practice by answering four basic questions which are frequently raised by managers and scholars when talking about the challenges of this approach: Do customers need customized products? If yes, what prevents them from purchasing these offerings? Do we have the enabling technologies for mass customization? And why do many firms fail during and after the introduction of mass customization? To answer these questions, this paper develops twelve propositions. These refer to terminological problems, a shortage of reliable information about the real demand for customized products in various markets, the state of implementation of configuration technologies, lack of management knowledge about organizational and strategic capabilities of mass customization operations, and the demand for sincere change management activities. These issues may explain why the present state of practical implementation of mass customization lacks behind the description and discussion of the phenomenon in the management literature.},

A modeling tool is developed to provide a development and data management platform. The man-machine collaboration is well defined in a structural format by the ability of task analysis method to address human task in a more flexible way. The collaboration modeling and operation resources information have significantly facilitated operation planning in both assembly and control levels. From the case study, the improvement in safety aspect has proven the ability of this approach in assisting safety design and development of production system. The integration with operation control system has shown the execution potential in real-time operation. The unique development of operation data management has expanded this work into operation information support. Through the multimodal information support system, the human operator is well guided by the operation information corresponded to the task components.

In this article, we introduce the KNOWROB knowledge processing system that is specifically designed to provide autonomous robots with the knowledge needed for performing everyday manipulation tasks. The system allows the realization of “virtual knowledge bases”: collections of knowledge pieces that are not explicitly represented but computed on demand from the robot’s internal data structures, its perception system, or external sources of information. This article gives an overview of the different kinds of knowledge, the different inference mechanisms, and interfaces for acquiring knowledge from external sources, such as the robot’s perception system, observations of human activities, Web sites on the Internet, as well as Web-based knowledge bases for information exchange between robots. We evaluate the system’s scalability and present different integrated experiments that show its versatility and comprehensiveness.},

abstract = {In this paper, a state space model is developed to describe the dimensional variation propagation of multistage machining processes. A complicated machining system usually contains multiple stages. When the workpiece passes through multiple stages, machining errors at each stage will be accumulated and transformed onto the workpiece. Differential motion vector, a concept from the robotics field, is used in this model as the state vector to represent the geometric deviation of the workpiece. The deviation accumulation and transformation are quantitatively described by the state transition in the state space model. A systematic procedure that builds the model is presented and an experimental validation is also conducted. The validation result is satisfactory. This model has great potential to be applied to fault diagnosis and process design evaluation for complicated machining processes.},
