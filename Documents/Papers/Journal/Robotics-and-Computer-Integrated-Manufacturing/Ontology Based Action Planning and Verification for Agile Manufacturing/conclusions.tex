\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sect:future}
The framework described in this paper has been applied in simulation to the domain of kit building, which is a simple, but practically useful manufacturing/assembly domain. The simulation features a hardware-in-the-loop design where the actual planning systems are running and communicating through CRCL commands to simulated hardware. Through this system's use, we have been able to demonstrate agility in both kit construction through late binding of part locations, and in the addition of additional actions and predicates to the system's vocabulary. 

While the basis set of actions is well understood (the NIST CRCL), the
vision action basis set is still not fully defined. Work is underway
to complete this definition, and the system will be modified to 
utilize the complete set when it becomes available. In addition,
work is currently underway to construct an implementation of the system on real robotic hardware. It is believed that once the basis set of operations has been programmed on the robot, the rest of the system will port without any code modifications. 

Extensions are also being investigated that will expand this work to the realm of general assembly. We hope to apply this knowledge based framework to simple assembly tasks (growing towards more complex tasks) on a real robot workcell in the near future.
