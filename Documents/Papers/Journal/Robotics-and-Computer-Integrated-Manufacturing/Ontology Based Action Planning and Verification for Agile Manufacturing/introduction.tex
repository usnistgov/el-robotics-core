\section{Introduction}
Many of today's robotic arms are capable of obtaining
sub-millimeter accuracy and repeatability \cite{RobotAccuracy}. However these
same systems lack
the sensors and processing necessary to provide a representation of
the work cell in which they reside or of the parts that they are working
with. In fact, according to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR),
over 95\% of all robots in use do not have a sensor in the outer feedback loop.
They rely on fixtures to allow them to be robust in the presence of 
uncertainty \cite{WorldRobot}. This leads to
systems that are taught or programmed to provide specific patterns of motion in
structured work cells over long production runs. 

Just-in-time manufacturing and small
batch processing requires changes in the manufacturing process on a batch-by-batch
or item-by-item basis. This leads to a reduction in the number of cycles
that a particular pattern of motion is useful and increases the 
percentage of time necessary for robot teaching or programming over actual cell operation.
This teaching/programming time requires that the 
cell be taken off-line which greatly impacts productivity.
For small batch processors or other customers who must frequently change their line configuration, 
this frequent downtime and lack of adaptability may be unacceptable.

The IEEE Robotics and Automation Society's Ontologies for Robotics and Automation Working Group has taken the 
first steps in creating a knowledge repository that will
allow greater intelligence to be resident on robotic platforms.
It is anticipated that proper applicaton of this intelligence
will lead to more agile and flexible robotic systems. The 
Industrial Subgroup of this working group has applied 
this infrastructure to 
create a sample kit building
system.  Kit building may be viewed as a simple, but relevant
manufacturing process. 

Balakirsky et al. \cite{Balakirsky2013} describe a kitting 
system that
allows greater flexibility and agility by utilizing a
Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) \cite{PDDL} planning
system to dynamically alter the system's operation in order
to adapt to variations in its anticipated work flow. The system
does not require {\it a priori} information on part locations (i.e
fixturing is not required) and is able to build new kit varieties
without altering the robot's programming. While this body of
work makes great strides in removing the need to teach/program
the robot between production runs, all of the PDDL predicates and
actions must still be programmed/taught. 

This means that any
modification to the production process that requires a new
PDDL predicate or action will still require that the production 
line be brought down for programming/teaching. The next logical step
in adding agility to robotic production is to remove this 
programming/teaching step when new actions and predicates
are required by the system. This article describes new work
that has been performed that removes the need to program
the robot for new predicates and actions. The sample domain of kit building is utilized
to demonstrate this work.

The organization of the remainder of this paper is as follows.
Section \ref{sect:PDDL} provides an overview of the PDDL language. 
Section \ref{sect:operation} discusses the detailed operation of cell, and Section \ref{sect:knowledge} discusses the knowledge representation and
the ontology. Finally, Section \ref{sect:future} presents
conclusions and future work.
