Two typical PDDL commands of {\it place-part} and {\it look-for-slot} 
are shown in Figure \ref{fig:Actions}. The {\it place-part} command
is used to put the currently held object into the ``slot'' of the kit
under construction that was found with the {\it look-for-slot} command.
If we assume that the action
{\it place-part} is being executed, then in line 4 of the {\sc BuildKit} algorithm
each of the predicates from the precondition section of the action 
will be verified. As previously mentioned, the evaluation of these predicates
could be hard-coded into the system. However, is there a more flexible way
that this could be accomplished?

\subsection{Predicate Representation}
If one examines each of the predicates that must be evaluated, it may be
noted that the predicates could be composed of a combination of simpler 
expressions. For example, the predicate expression:
\begin{gather} 
\class{endEffector-has-heldObject}(\textit{endeffector}, 
\textit{stockkeepingunit}),
\label{equation:endEffector-has-heldObject}
\end{gather}
is designed to verify that the robot's end-effector is holding the correct lass of part. It may be decomposed into the compound expression: 
\begin{gather}
\textbf{matchSKU}(\textbf{In-Contact-With}(\textit{endeffector}), stockkeepingunit)
\label{equation:matchSKU}
\end{gather}
In this case, \textit{endeffector} is the instance of the class end effector
that is expected to be attached to the robot
and 
\textit{stockkeepingunit} is the instance of the stock keeping unit
that belongs to the part that is expected to be held by the robot.
The expression \textbf{In-Contact-With} will determine what class of object is being held by the effector, while the expression \textbf{matchSKU} will determine if this represents the expected class.
 
The expressions \textbf{In-Contact-With} and \textbf{matchSKU}
are known as Intermediate State Relations (ISR) because the relate
complex elements of the system's state to easily measurable or
observable phenomenon. When called with a single parameter,
the measurable ISR of 
\textbf{In-Contact-With}(\textit{endeffector}) will return
a list of objects that are in contact with the end effector. 
This list will be passed as parameters to the observable
ISR of \textbf{matchSKU}. Since this relation is
expecting exactly two parameters, an end effector touching
zero or more than one object will result in an error. If a
single object is being held, it will be passed to \textbf{matchSKU} where
a simple observation may be made to see if the object's SKU
matches the one provided in the second parameter.

\subsubsection{RCC-8 Relation}
All of the measurable intermediate state relations may be further
decomposed into expressions that may be easily computed from
knowledge of the six degree-of-freedom pose of the objects. 
These base expressions are know
as Region Connected Calculus (RCC-8) relations and were originally
developed by Wolter and Zakharyaschev \cite{Wolter2000} 
as an approach for representing the relationship between two regions in 
Euclidean or topological space. 
RCC-8 consists of eight possible relations (hence RCC-8) that include
measurable region-to-region relationships such as
Tangential Proper Part (TPP) and Externally Connected (EC). 

In order to represent these relations in all three dimensions for 
industrial domains, RCC-8 has been extended to a three-dimensional space 
by applying it along all three planes (x-y, x-z, y-z) and by including 
cardinal direction relations ``+'' and ``-''. In our example of
Equation \ref{equation:matchSKU}, 
\textbf{In-Contact-With}(\textit{endeffector}) may be expressed
in RCC-8 relations as:
\begin{gather}
\textbf{In-Contact-With}(\textit{obj1}, \textit{obj2}) \rightarrow   \notag\\
\texttt{x-EC}(\textit{obj1}, \textit{obj2}) \vee \texttt{y-EC}(\textit{obj1}, \textit{obj2}) \vee \texttt{z-EC}(\textit{obj1},\textit{obj2}) \notag
\end{gather} 
Where \textit{EC} stands for Externally Connected, obj1 is the end effector, and obj2 is 
cycled through all of the detected objects in the work cell. 
\subsection{Observable Relations}
Work is still being performed to relate all of the simple observations to observable relations. In the case of the \textbf{matchSKU} observation, a \textit{model-match} or \textit{view-sku} operation could be performed. More on this topic is presented in Section \ref{sect:future}.
\subsection{Action Execution}
Once the precondition predicates have been validated, line 8 of the \textsc{BuildKit}
algorithm in Figure \ref{fig:buildkit} shows that the action should be executed. Once
again it is possible to decompose the complex actions into a much simpler form. 
In this case, two separate basis sets exist with one designed for the decomposition 
of Robot Actions and the other for the decomposition of Vision Actions.

\subsubsection{Canonical Robot Command Language}
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed a
robot language known
as the Canonical Robotic Command Language (CRCL) that is designed to provide
a basis set of operations for robotic arms with industrial use 
cases \cite{Balakirsky2012-1}. This language contains 22 command elements that
may be sequenced to perform any of the PDDL Robot Actions that have been defined
for this domain. Continuing our example from above, 
Figure \ref{fig:PlacePartCRCL} displays the decomposition of the \textit{place-part} action.
As may be seen in the figure, the command decomposes into several movements and a gripper
command. The movements to a ``safe" location are not strictly necessary, but are
included to assure that the arm's motion begins and ends from a known safe position.
This position is a predefined constant in the system.
\textit{FOUND\_SLOT} is another system constant that represents a position buffer in 
the system. This buffer has previously been filled with the location of the actual
slot that is the destination of the part with the PDDL action 
\textit{look-for-slot}. 

Once the command execution is complete, the predicates that make up the effects
are examined in the same manner as the previously examined precondition predicates.
If any of the effects are deemed to have not occurred, then an error will be
generated.
