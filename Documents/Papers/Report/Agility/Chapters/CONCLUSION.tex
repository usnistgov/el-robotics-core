In this report, we present a literature review of agility methods, metrics, and use cases that are attempting to enhance the agility of robots in manufacturing environments.  While not comprehensive, this literature review provides a nice overview of the approaches that have been applied in the field.

In addition to the literature review, a series of industry interactions have recently occurred to hear firsthand from industry about the challenges they are facing in the area of robot agility. In addition, interactions are also focusing on identifying relevant use case scenarios that can help to scope the effort. This interaction is still in its early stage so details are not reported in this document; future documents will focus on this area.
