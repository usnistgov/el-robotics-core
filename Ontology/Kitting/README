Documentation on the ontology may be found in the Documents\Manuals\Ontology
directory of the repository.

Most of the OWL files in this directory were produced by processing XML
data files in the owlPrinter utility. The owlPrinter utility may be found
in repository/ipmas/xml2owl. The repository/ipmas/xml2owl/data directory
contains the data files corresponding to the OWL instance files in this
directory. The names of corresponding files are identical except that the
OWL files have a .owl suffix and the XML files have a .xml suffix. The XML
schema, kitting.xsd, corresponding to kittingClasses.owl may be found
in repository/ipmas/xml2owl/schema.
