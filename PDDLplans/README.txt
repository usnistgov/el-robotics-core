Each directory contains a PDDL plan file and the corresponding PDDL domain and problem files used to generate the plan.

-domain-fluents.pddl is common to all the kits. Therefore, this file is placed in this current directory.

-KittingVlasses.owl and kittingInstances.owl 
The files are the ones to use with the Generator in order to generate the C++ classes for the database.

-kittingInstances.owlCreateTable.sql and kittingInstances.owlInsertinto.sql
The files were built by the generator using the 2 owl files above.
