\section*{CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK}\label{s:conclusion}
This paper has presented a new ROS package that allows for the seemless interface of USARSim with ROS. The package provides for auto-discovery of robots and sensors, and produces the standard ROS topics that one would expect from a physical platform. Further work is still required to auto-generate ROS launch files for running standard motion control algorithms for both platform and arm control. In addition, additional sensors must have their USARSim interfaces wrapped to be supported in the ROS environment.
