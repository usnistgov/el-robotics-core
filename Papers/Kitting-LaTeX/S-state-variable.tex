\section{State-Variable Representation}
In a state-variable representation, each state is represented by a
tuple of values of $n$ state variables $\lbrace x_1,\dots,x_n\rbrace$, and each action is represented
by a partial function that maps this tuple into some other tuple of values of the
$n$ state variables. 
\begin{comment}
This approach is especially useful for representing domains
in which a state is a set of attributes that range over finite domains and whose
values change over time.
