\subsubsection{Ground and Unground State Variable}
A state variable $x(c_1,\dots,c_k)$ is \textit{ground} if each $c_i$ is a constant in $D_{i}^{x}$. A state variable $x(v_1,\dots,v_k)$ is \textit{unground} if one or more of $v_1,\dots,v_k$ are object variables. For example, gloc({\constant{g}}) is an unground state variable and gloc({\constant{g1}}) is a ground state variables.


A state variable is intended to be a characteristic attribute of a state. Hence, in
this representation a state $s$ is specified by giving the values in $s$ of all the ground
state variables. More specifically, for every ground state variable $x(c_1,\dots,c_k)$, a state
$s$ includes a syntactic expression of the form $x(c_1,\dots,c_k)=c_{k+1}$ such that $c_{k+1}$ is
the value of $x(c_1,\dots,c_k)$ in $s$, each $c_i$ being a constant in the appropriate range.\\

Considering the kitting domain described in Section~\ref{kitting_domain}, state $s_0$ can be described as follows.

%Considering the kitting problem that has one robot ($r1$), three kit trays ($kt1,kt2,kt3$), two end effectors %($eef1,eef2$), three part trays ($pt1,pt2,pt3$), one working table ($wt1$), two locations for the end %effectors ($eeffloc1,eeffloc2$), one stack for empty trays ($stemp1$), one stack for full trays ($stfull1$), %three different kit parts ($kp1,kp2,kp3$), and two locations for the kit trays ($ktloc1,ktloc2$). An example %for state $S_0$ for this possible can be defined as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{$\blacksquare$}
\renewcommand{\labelitemii}{$\square$}
\item $s_0=\lbrace$ \textit{gloc}({\constant{g1}})=\chstation, \textit{gloc}({\constant{g2}})={\constant{chstation}}, \textit{ktloc}({\constant{kt1}})={\constant{boxekt1}}, \textit{ktloc}({\constant{kt2}})={\constant{boxekt1}}, \textit{ktloc}({\constant{kt3}})={\constant{boxekt1}}, \textit{ploc}({\constant{p1}})={\constant{ps1}}, \textit{ploc}({\constant{p2}})={\constant{ps2}}, \textit{ploc}({\constant{p3}})={\constant{ps3}} $\rbrace$
