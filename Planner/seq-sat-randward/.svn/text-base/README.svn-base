RANDWARD

Version: January 2011
Developer: Alan Olsen

The base-code for this planner comes from the December 2010 version of
LAMA, (c) 2008 by Silvia Richter and Matthias Westphal, which is derived
from Fast Downward, (c) 2003-2004 by Malte Helmert and Silvia Richter.
It was obtained and may be redistributed under the GNU General Public
Liscence (see "LISCENCE" file).

To build for Unix/Linux, run "./build"
(If that doesn't work, simply compiling and linking together all of the
C++ source files in each directory should do the trick)

To execute the planner, run "./plan <domain> <problem> <results-file>"
(Python 2.5 or later is required)
