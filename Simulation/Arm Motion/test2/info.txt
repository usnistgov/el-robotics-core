URDF file variations within KDL plugin tests:
"joint coordinates" or "old generator" refers to using transformed joint orientation frames in the URDF file so that the joint axis of rotation always points along +z.
"nojoint" or "new generator" means using the same orientation frame for every joint and changing the axis of rotation.
"box collisions" means using a 0.05x0.05 box, with a length 80% that of the actual arm link, as the collision model for the link.
"accurate collisions" or "real collisions" means using the collision models built in Blender from the arm visual models.
 "perp" or "hand-adjusted" means that the joint axes of rotation on the URDF model were adjusted to be perpendicular and axis-aligned. For instance, axes pointing along (0.002, -1.000, 0.000) were changed to (0.000, -1.000, 0.000).
 
The IKFast plugin uses the new generator and a hand-adjusted URDF, since it will NOT work otherwise. It also uses the more accurate collision models.
