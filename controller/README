Build instructions for the ROS Canonical Controller:

  1. Build the most recent version of the USARSim ROS interface with
    $ rosmake usarsim_inf
  2. In this directory (ipmas/controller), run "make" to build the controller library files.
  3. Build the ROS controller by entering the RosCanonicalController directory and running "make".
  
  Important: Follow these steps in the order given! The controller may not work otherwise. 


  
Running the ROS Canonical Controller with a stand-alone robot:
  1. launch the robot with
    $ roslaunch usarsim_inf [robot_launch_file.launch]
  2. launch arm navigation with 
    $ roslaunch [robot_name]_arm_navigation [robot_name]_arm_navigation.launch
  3. run the controller with
    $ rosrun rosCanonicalController rosCanonicalController [command_file_name.txt]
Use of a command file in step 3 is optional; if none is specified then the controller will use stdio for input.
