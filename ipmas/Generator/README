generator_no_gui.jar usage:

./generator_no_gui.jar -owl owlInputFile [-sql sql_output_directory|-cpp cpp_output_directory]

where:
  owlInputFile: relative or absolute path to the .owl file to use to generate the code
  sql_output_directory: relative or absolute path to the directory to place the generated .sql files
  cpp_output_directory: relative or absolute path to the directory to place the generated .cpp, .h, and .sql files

If the -sql option is used, only the owlCreateTable.sql and owlInsertInto.sql files are generated. If the -cpp option is used, then the .cpp and .h files will be created, with the .sql files in the same directory. Exactly one of these options should be specified.


-----BUILD INSTRUCTIONS-----

To build the GUI or command-line source generators:
1. Run Eclipse
2. Select "New Java Project", uncheck "use default location", and use the OwlToSql directory as the location.
3. Add HermiT.jar and org.semanticweb.HermiT.jar to the new project libraries
4. Run GUI.jar or CommandLine.jar from inside Eclipse
5. Select File->Export and export either launch configuration as a runnable jar
