This directory contains sample OWL kitting workstation instance files
and other items. 

The kitting workstation OWL files in this directory were produced by
processing XML kitting workstation instance files in the
owlKittingWorkstationPrinter utility found in
repository/ipmas/xml/kittingWorkstation/bin. The
repository/ipmas/xml/kittingWorkstation/xmlInstanceFiles directory
contains the XML instance files corresponding to the OWL instance
files in this directory. The names of corresponding files are
identical except that the OWL files have a .owl suffix and the XML
files have a .xml suffix. The XML schema, kittingWorkstation.xsd,
corresponding to kittingWorkstationClasses.owl may be found in
repository/ipmas/xml/kittingWorkstation/xmlSchemas.
