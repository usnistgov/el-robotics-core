\mainpage Agile Manufacturing for Assembly Operations
This code is a collection of programs that is designed to
transform knowledge from ontologies into real-time databases
that may be used for assembly operations in dynamic environments
and situations. Code includes tools for data conversion and
manipulation, interfaces to ROS and USARSim, as well as
PDDL planning code and executors that tie the entire system togeter.

This codebase is jointly developed by Georgia Tech Research Institute
and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
