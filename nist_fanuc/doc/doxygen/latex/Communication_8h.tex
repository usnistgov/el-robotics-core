\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
class \hyperlink{classCJointReader}{C\-Joint\-Reader}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em The \hyperlink{classCJointReader}{C\-Joint\-Reader} is a thread to accept joint update callbacks from R\-O\-S. Uses a ros node handle to tell roscore we are subscribing to joint\-\_\-state topic. Then, when joint updates occur, the callback routine is invoked and the latest joint values saved. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \hyperlink{classCJointWriter}{C\-Joint\-Writer}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em The \hyperlink{classCJointWriter}{C\-Joint\-Writer} is a thread to publish new joint values to R\-O\-S. Uses a ros node handle to tell roscore we are pusblishing to the joint\-\_\-path\-\_\-command topic. Then, when joint updates occur, these are published on joint\-\_\-path\-\_\-command the topic. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
