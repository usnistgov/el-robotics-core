\subsection*{Classes}
\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
class \hyperlink{classCJointReader}{C\-Joint\-Reader}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em The \hyperlink{classCJointReader}{C\-Joint\-Reader} is a thread to accept joint update callbacks from R\-O\-S. Uses a ros node handle to tell roscore we are subscribing to joint\-\_\-state topic. Then, when joint updates occur, the callback routine is invoked and the latest joint values saved. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \hyperlink{classCJointWriter}{C\-Joint\-Writer}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em The \hyperlink{classCJointWriter}{C\-Joint\-Writer} is a thread to publish new joint values to R\-O\-S. Uses a ros node handle to tell roscore we are pusblishing to the joint\-\_\-path\-\_\-command topic. Then, when joint updates occur, these are published on joint\-\_\-path\-\_\-command the topic. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \hyperlink{classCLinkReader}{C\-Link\-Reader}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em The \hyperlink{classCLinkReader}{C\-Link\-Reader} is a class that use the tf package from R\-O\-S to return latest pose of a link. Uses tf to find the latest time and base\-\_\-link and the desired link have changed. With the latest time it returns translation and orientation (quat) of the link. tf keeps track of a tree of coordinate frames. This tree changes over time, and tf stores a time snapshot for every transform (for up to 10 seconds by default). \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
