Git\-Hub is a web-\/based Git repository hosting service. It is based on git revision control system. Unlike Git, which is strictly a command-\/line tool, Git\-Hub provides a Web-\/based graphical interface and desktop as well as mobile integration.

\subsection*{github command line interface }

git commit -\/a (added files) normally git commit . V\-I\-M nightmare\-: esc and \-:wq (write and quit)

\subsection*{git remote changes and incorporate into local repository }

You cannot just \char`\"{}git fetch\char`\"{} remote changes, they will not be incorporated into your local repository unless you {\bfseries merge} them. So must use \char`\"{}git merge remotebranchname\char`\"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}https://help.github.com/articles/fetching-a-remote/

michalos@rufous:~/github/usnistgov/el-robotics-core$ git merge origin

\subsection*{Github branch with versions }

In your github fork, you need to keep your master branch clean, by clean I mean without any changes, like that you can create at any time a branch from your master. Each time, that you want to commit a bug or a feature, you need to create a branch for it, which will be a copy of your master branch.

When you do a pull request on a branch, you can continue to work on another branch and make another pull request on this other branch.

Before creating a new branch, pull the changes from upstream. Your master needs to be up to date.

Create the branch on your local machine and switch in this branch \-:


\begin{DoxyPre}\$ git checkout -b [name\_of\_your\_new\_branch]\end{DoxyPre}


Push the branch on github \-:


\begin{DoxyPre}\$ git push origin [name\_of\_your\_new\_branch]\end{DoxyPre}


When you want to commit something in your branch, be sure to be in your branch.

You can see all branches created by using \-:


\begin{DoxyPre}\$ git branch\end{DoxyPre}


Which will show \-:


\begin{DoxyPre}* approval\_messages\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}  master\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}  master\_clean\end{DoxyPre}


Add a new remote for your branch \-:


\begin{DoxyPre}\$ git remote add [name\_of\_your\_remote] <url>\end{DoxyPre}


Push changes from your commit into your branch \-:


\begin{DoxyPre}\$ git push origin [name\_of\_your\_remote]\end{DoxyPre}


Update your branch when the original branch from official repository has been updated \-:

```sh

\$ git fetch \mbox{[}name\-\_\-of\-\_\-your\-\_\-remote\mbox{]}

```

Then you need to apply to merge changes, if your branch is derivated from develop you need to do \-:


\begin{DoxyPre}\$ git merge [name\_of\_your\_remote]/develop\end{DoxyPre}


Delete a branch on your local filesystem \-:


\begin{DoxyPre}\$ git branch -d [name\_of\_your\_new\_branch]\end{DoxyPre}


To force the deletion of local branch on your filesystem \-:


\begin{DoxyPre}\$ git branch -D [name\_of\_your\_new\_branch]\end{DoxyPre}


Delete the branch on github \-:


\begin{DoxyPre}\$ git push origin :[name\_of\_your\_new\_branch]\end{DoxyPre}


The only difference is the \-: to say delete, you can do it too by using github interface to remove branch \-: \href{https://help.github.com/articles/deleting-unused-branches}{\tt https\-://help.\-github.\-com/articles/deleting-\/unused-\/branches}.

If you want to change default branch, it's so easy with github, in your fork go into Admin and in the drop-\/down list default branch choose what you want.
