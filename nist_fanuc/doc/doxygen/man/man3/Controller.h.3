.RI "\fIThe \fBCController\fP provides a collection for all the relevant controller pieces\&. The \fBCController\fP is the main controller class to collect all the references/pointers to instances in the project\&. A global instance of this class, called 'Controller', is created and is used throughout the code to reference various instances of control objects (e\&.g\&., kinematics, joint writer, joint reader, etc\&.) \fP"

.RI "\fIThe \fBRobotStatus\fP is a thread that reads the status of the robot and updates the world model\&. The \fBRobotStatus\fP is a separate thread that reads the robot status using ROS communication mechanisms and updates the controller world model based on these values\&. Currently, it uses an instance of the class JointReader to read joint values from the controller\&. It uses a Kinematics pointer reference to compute the current robot pose using the forward kinematics (FK) routine\&. It also uses a CrclDelegate pointer reference to update the status reported by CRCL\&. \fP"

However, program as in the \fBCrcl\fP XSD specification, so it doesn't hurt to handle\&. They require special handling as only one command should be done at a time\&. Uses codesynthesis to parse \fBCrcl\fP xml into C++ data structures\&. \fP"
