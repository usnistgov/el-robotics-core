However, program as in the \fBCrcl\fP XSD specification, so it doesn't hurt to handle\&. They require special handling as only one command should be done at a time\&. Uses codesynthesis to parse \fBCrcl\fP xml into C++ data structures\&.

.SS "void RCS::RobotProgram::Action ()\fC [virtual]\fP"

.PP
Action is the main loop in the \fBRobotProgram\fP \fBRCS\fP thread\&. Executes one program command at a time\&.  needs to wait until current command is done before moving on to next command\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBRCS::Thread\fP\&.

.PP
ExecuteProgram reads a file path for CRCL XML program\&. It will set up interpreting the program\&. It is thread safe\&.
