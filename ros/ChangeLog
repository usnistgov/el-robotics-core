	* The fanuc rviz moveit was kind of choppy probably due to KDL
	being too slow an IK solver. TrakIK is speeded up
	KDL. Unfortunately, ikfast is compiled to a URDF configuration,
	and until we figure out which URDF matches the real robot
	position/offset its really wrong.

	Does trac ik plug in work? Improve performance?
	Does rosi joint state publisher work?
	What is URDF for actual fanuc robot?  Offset? Pedastel?
	Can we generate new ikfast files from CORRECT urdf?

	* Ran planning visualization
         roslaunch fanuc_lrmate200id_moveit_config moveit_planning_execution.launch
	launched ok but collisions occur frequently need to change collision in urdf
	Changed for base_link:
	      <collision>
        	<origin xyz="0 0 -0.165" rpy="0 0 0"/>

	* Ran visualization simulation:
          Compile
	  source ./devel/setup.bash
	  roslaunch fanuc_lrmate200id_support  test_lrmate200id.launch
	THIS WORKED
	* Modified kinematics plugin to use kdl instead of ikfast until we can  use ikfast builder:
	 rosed <myrobot_namefanuc_lrmate200id_moveit_config/config/kinematics.yaml
         kinematics_solver: kdl_kinematics_plugin/KDLKinematicsPlugin
        (was fanuc_lrmate200id_manipulator_kinematics/IKFastKinematicsPlugin)
	* modified  ./fanuc_ws/src/fanuc_lrmate200id_support/urdf/lrmate200id_macro.xacro  so that fanuc pedastel to  is now (0,0,0)
