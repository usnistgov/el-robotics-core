Ulapi is a software library that implements an application programming
interface to common operating system functions for starting tasks,
accessing timers and setting up interprocess communication using
shared memory, mutexes and semaphores. If you code to the Ulapi API,
then your code can run on Linux or Windows.

If you are using Ulapi for Linux, read README.Linux.
