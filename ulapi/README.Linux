Quick Start Guide to building and demoing Ulapi for Linux
-------------------------------------------------------------
The INSTALL file has general instructions for compiling software built
using Autotools, as Ulapi has been. A summary, and more specific
instructions, follow here.

1. Obtain and unpack the Ulapi distribution, which you have
probably already done if you're reading this README. This would have
been something like this:

you> tar xzvf ulapi-1.X.tar.gz
you> cd ulapi-1.X
you> ./configure
you> make
you> make install prefix=/usr/local/ulapi

2. Run the test:

you> cd ulapi-1.X
you> bin/ultest

You should see diagnostics output similar to this:

ultest timer passed
ultest shared memory test passed
waiter 0 waiting for condition...
waiter 1 waiting for condition...
waiter 2 waiting for condition...
working on condition...
working on condition...
working on condition...
working on condition...
broadcasting condition
waiter 1 condition met
waiter 2 condition met
waiter 0 condition met
ultest condition variable test passed
ultest gethostname test passed

3. Your own application code that uses the Ulapi functions will need
to be compiled with the path to Ulapi, e.g., 

   gcc yourfile.c -I/usr/local/ulapi/include -L/usr/local/ulapi/lib -lulapi

4. See the HTML documentation in doxygen-doc/html/index.html for many
more details on the software.
