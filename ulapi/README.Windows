Quick Start Guide to building and demoing Ulapi for Windows
-------------------------------------------------------------
The INSTALL file has general instructions for compiling software built
using Autotools for Linux. Those instructions do not apply here. The
Windows parts are found in ulapi\win32api.

1. Obtain and unzip the Ulapi distribution, which you have
probably already done if you're reading this README.

2. There is no Install Shield script -- this is the full source code
distribution so you'll need to compile it yourself using Microsoft
Visual C++ Express 2010. This is free. Install this if you haven't.

3. Go into the ulapi\win32api folder and double-click the "ulapi.sln"
file to launch Microsoft Visual C++ Express 2010. Build the solution.

4. Run the test by going into the Debug folder and running
ultest.exe. You should see diagnostics output similar to this:

ultest timer passed
ultest shared memory test passed
waiter 0 waiting for condition...
waiter 1 waiting for condition...
waiter 2 waiting for condition...
working on condition...
working on condition...
working on condition...
working on condition...
broadcasting condition
waiter 1 condition met
waiter 2 condition met
waiter 0 condition met
ultest condition variable test passed
ultest gethostname test passed

4. Install the resulting files by running the "install.bat" file. This
puts the header files and library in C:\Program Files\ulapi.

5. Your own application code that uses the Ulapi functions will need
to be compiled with the path to Ulapi, so in your own solution, make
sure to add the include path and library path to C:\Program
Files\ulapi\include and \lib.

6. See the HTML documentation in doxygen-doc/html/index.html for many
more details on the software.
