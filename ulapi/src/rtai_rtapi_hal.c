  \defgroup RTAIHAL The RTAI Hardware Abstraction Layer

  The RTAI implementation of the \ref RTAPI real-time application
  programming interface has a hardware abstraction layer (HAL) that
  sets the timer base period and initializes global variables used by
  real-time processes.

  RTAPI_HAL_NSECS_PER_PERIOD is the base period of the timer. It
  should be as small as possible, since all tasks in all RT
  applications will run at multiples of this period. If a high-speed
  task like a stepper motor controller is also running, this should be
  set to be as small as that task needs.
