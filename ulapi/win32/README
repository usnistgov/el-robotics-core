This is the Windows implementation of Ulapi.

To build, open 'ulapi.sln' in Microsoft Visual C++. The project was
set up with VC++ Express 2010 and may be converted by more recent VC++
versions. 

Do a "Build" in VC++. The executables end up in the Debug folder. 

Install it to C:\Program Files\ulapi by running the 'install.bat'
script.

Put "C:Program Files\ulapi\bin" in the PATH variable in your Windows
environment, by right-clicking on "My Computer" -> "Properties", or
something similar depending your your version of windows, and then
looking for environment variables under advanced settings.
